Kai Ju is Minimal API Gateway

## Features
Key Functions of an API Gateway:
- Request Routing: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate service based on URL, method, headers, or other rules.
- Load Balancing: Distributes incoming requests to multiple instances of a service, ensuring no single instance gets overwhelmed.
- Authentication & Authorization: Verifies the identity of the requester (authentication) and determines whether they have the right permissions to access a particular resource (authorization).
- Rate Limiting: Restricts a clientâ€™s requests in a specified time window, protecting services from potential abuse or overloads.
